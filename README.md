# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

##### Overview

As a second tech test, we were given the infamous Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata, created by Terry Hughes. You can find the Kata on Github [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) and starting code for multiple programming languages [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

I highly recommend watching Sandi Metz's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE&t=646s) which uses a simplified version of the Ruby code to showcase the importance of Single Responsibility and Open/Close Design Principles of the Object Oriented Programming. 

##### Usage

* Clone repository
* `cd` to the project's root directory
* Run `gem install bundler`
* Run `bundle install` to install all of the required gems
* Run `rspec` to make sure that all tests are passing
* Run `ruby textest_fixture.rb` in the terminal. You can specify a number of days after the command.

##### Tech

* Ruby
* RSpec
